Task 1:

# Setup TypeScript:

Install TypeScript and configure tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled.

# Practice Core Types:

Define variables with number, string, boolean, array, and tuple.

# Work with union and literal types.

Example: Create a function that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, where each item is represented as a tuple: [name: string, price: number].

```
You need to create a function that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart.

Each item in the cart will be stored as a tuple (a fixed-size list where the order and types of elements are important).
For each item, the tuple will have two values:
The name of the item as a string (e.g., "Apple").
The price of the item as a number (e.g., 10.99).
Your function should add up the prices of all items in the cart and return the total.

Would you like to proceed with hints or the solution? ðŸ˜Š
```

```ts

const items:[string, number]=[["Apple", 43],["Apple", 43],["Apple", 43]]

function totalCost(){}

totalCost([item:string, price:number])

```

# Real-World Scenario:

Create a program that processes a list of employee records.
Each employee has id, name, age, and optional department.
Write a function to filter employees by age and group them by department.

```ts
interface Employee {
  id: number | string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  department?: string;
}

function filterEmp(emp: Employee) {}

filterEmp();
```
