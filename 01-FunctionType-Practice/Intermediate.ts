// Intermediate Level Tasks
// Write a function that accepts:

type Product = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  category: string;
};

// An array of OrderItem objects (as defined earlier).
// A string representing a product name.
// The function should return the total quantity ordered for that product.
// Create a function:

// That takes an array of products and returns a filtered list of products within a given price range.
// The price range should be passed as two numbers: minPrice and maxPrice.
// Define a function that:

// Takes an array of strings as input.
// Returns a single string that concatenates all strings in the array, separated by a comma.
