// Challenge Tasks
// Write a function:
// That takes an array of numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) as arguments.
// The function applies the operation to all numbers and returns the result.
// Create a generic function:
// That accepts an array of any type and a callback function.
// The callback function is applied to each element in the array, and the modified array is returned.
// Combine everything:
// Create a comprehensive program that:
// Manages an inventory of products.
// Processes orders by updating the inventory.
// Calculates the total cost of orders.
// Ensures all types are validated using function typing.
